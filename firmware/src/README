This directory contains the project source code.

Source files (.cpp) implement the application logic and reference project
headers located in the include/ directory using "#include".

The codebase is organised by responsibility to keep concerns separated
and the firmware easy to scale and maintain.

___

Directory structure:

src/
├─ config/        Configuration handling and secret credentials
├─ hardware/      Low-level hardware drivers and peripherals
├─ network/       Network connectivity and protocols
├─ services/      Application-level services and integrations
├─ util/          Shared utilities and helper functions
├─ main.cpp       Application entry point and orchestration

___

Directory descriptions:

config/
Runtime and build-time configuration sources (e.g. settings, secrets).

hardware/
Hardware abstraction and device drivers (camera, sensors, storage, etc).

network/
Networking and communication layers (WiFi, MQTT, protocols).

services/
High-level features and external service integrations
(cloud services, messaging, APIs).

util/
Common utilities shared across the project
(error handling, logging, time helpers).

main.cpp
Program entry point. Responsible for initialisation and coordinating
the main application flow.

___

Notes:

Each .cpp file typically has a corresponding header in include/.

Headers expose interfaces; source files contain implementations.

This structure is designed to support modular firmware development
and clear separation of concerns.
